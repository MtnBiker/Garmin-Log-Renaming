Renames Garmin 60CSx files to current date with hyphens to distinguish from original files and for readablility. And annotates the <name> field

First copies files from Garmin to a folder on the Mac, then copies and renames those files to another folder (Massaged) and then annotates the <name> field with location and easy to read dates. 

Corrects for Daylight Saving Time.

The files in the Massaged folder are named (dated) using local time, since that is what is really in the file.
