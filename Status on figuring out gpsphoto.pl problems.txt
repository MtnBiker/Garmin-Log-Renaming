Problem getting geoinfo for point 37.275066,-109.647652. Get no other errors. But nothing added to the file. No coordinates or geo information. This seems like a gpsphoto.pl error.

Use of uninitialized value $text in pattern match (m//) at /Users/gscar/Documents/Ruby/NumberMovieEtc/Photo renaming, movie, gps-Current/gpsPhoto.pl line 3120.
But this photo got coordinates and location information. And coincidentally, this is for a photo where its jpg companion got no information

Problem getting geoinfo for point 37.276170,-109.647571.
Guess city=Bluff
Coordinates and city found, but "Problem getting geoinfoâ€¦" and nothing written to the file.

Could not find a coordinate. // Presumably, not close enough in time. NO DIDN'T MOVE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. No I gave it a 40 minute window (20 by default=1200 seconds). I think by default it looks to the file for the day, and in my  case the data may be in the file the day before or after

=============
"Found coordinates for 1" is the only condition that information is written to the file.

Problem getting geoinfo for point 37.275066,-109.647652.
nothing written to file although obviously data was found

=============
TO DO

Can parse the input for "Problem getting geoinfo for point 37.275066,-109.647652" and write that data in using EXIFtool. Should wait and see if a fix is offered. Not seeing this now.


Understand how to parse YAML and use it to determine the time zone. Need also to understand how to get info between two points. Quotes aren't supposed to be needed in YAML.

Work out a retry mechanism for files moved to Problems folder. Make sure that photos for which no data exists aren't put there.
